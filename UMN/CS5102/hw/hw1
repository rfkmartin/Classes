#include <sys/utsname.h>

...

main()
{
struct utsname *n_name;

...

   uname(n_name);

   printf("Nodename = %s\n", n_name.nodename);

2.2  Stack sizes are dynamically created so that their size is not constant. The
     text segment and the initialize and uninitialzed data segments are known

3  passwd is a program that accesses the password file of the system and makes
   changes accordingly. Since only the superuser has access to this file, there
   needs to be a way for a user to change his own password entry. By making
   passwd a 'set-user-ID' program, this allows each user to run this root owned
   program and then have access to the password file, without being allowed
   access to other users' passwords.
